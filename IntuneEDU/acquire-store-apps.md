# Get apps from the Microsoft Store for Education

View and distribute apps you've bought from the Microsoft Store for Education. 
To manage your Store apps from the Intune for Education portal, make sure that [you've associated your Intune for Education account](https://docs.microsoft.com/education/get-started/configure-microsoft-store-for-education) with your Store account.  

After you're set up, visit the Microsoft Store documentation to learn [how to acquire Store apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-store/find-and-acquire-apps-overview) for your school.

From there, all apps that you purchase from the store will automatically appear in your Intune for Education inventory.  

## Next steps
To learn more about [acquiring Store apps through the full Intune management experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/deploy-use/manage-apps-you-purchased-from-the-windows-store-for-business-with-microsoft-intune), see the Intune documentation.  

When you're ready, [assign apps](assign-apps.md) to user and device groups in Intune for Education.
